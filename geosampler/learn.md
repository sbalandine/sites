Welcome to the **Learn GeoSampler manual**. You will find here full documentation and tutorials for learning to use **GeoSampler**.

Before starting using GeoSampler, you may be interested in knowing what is [GeoSampler about and why GeoSampler was created](about.html).

If you are not familiar with GeoSampler, have a look at the [Getting started](getting.started.html) page.

# Tutorials

We have created step-by-step tutorials of how to use GeoSampler. These are in a form of case study. These tutorials are also used during training held by Epicentre.

* Prepare a geographic sample

  * [By random sampling of roofs](learn.step.by.step.1.html)
  * [By spatial sampling](learn.step.by.step.2.html)
  * [By spatial sampling supervised](learn.step.by.step.3.html)

For any questions or suggestions about this website, please contact the Epicentre training unit (mailto:Elise.RODARY@epicentre.msf.org).
